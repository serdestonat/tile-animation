For this, you'll need Elementor and WP Code Lite Code Snippets plugins.

Put the HTML code inside the Elementor using the "HTML" feature. When you put the HTML code, go to the Advanced section inside the "Edit HTML".
When you scroll down, you will see a section called "Custom CSS". Paste you CSS code there. 

After that, in your code snippets and create a custom JavaScript Snippet and paste your JS code there.

Adjust the codes to your way of use.
